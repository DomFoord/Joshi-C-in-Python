# Joshi-C-in-Python
This is a pythonised version of the c++ pricers given in the book "C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives Pricing". For now it is largely based on pre-existing code available at https://github.com/IgnacioAnguita/C-Design-Patterns-and-Derivatives-Pricing-recoded - indeed I make no particular claims of originality in my code at this moment in time (March 2021). However, depending on how things play out I aim to a) finish the book and b) burnish the underlying algorithms in a more "pythonic" fashion.

Update, 09/03/2021 - I will leave this unfinished, and point anyone interested in the direction of the above link.
